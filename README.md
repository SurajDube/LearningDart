Data Types:
    1. Number
            int (whole numbers (64-bit Max))
            double (64-bit precise floating-point numbers.)
            num (inherited data type of the int and double types.)
            BigInt (For very large integers that exceed int limits, use BigInt.)

    5. Sets (Set)
    6. Maps (Map)
    7. Runes (Runes)

Control Flow:
    Conditional Statements (Labels in Dart):
        if, if-else
    Looping Statements:
        for loop
        for... in loop
        for each loop
        while loop
        do-while loop

Object-Oriented Programming:
    1. Classes And Objects: 
        Variables & Methods,
        Constructor:
            Default Constructor
            Parameterized Constructor
            Named Constructor
    2. Encapsulation: Partial implementation Data Hiding
        Getter and Setter Methods (accessors and mutators)
    3. Inheritance: Dart does not directly support multiple inheritance like java.
        1. Single Inheritance
        2. Multilevel Inheritance
        3. Hierarchical Inheritance
        4. multiple inheritance (not support)
    4. Polymorphism (Method overloading and method overriding):
        Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
        Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)
    5. Abstraction: Data Hiding fully implementation
        abstract classes, 
        abstract methods,
        interfaces
    6. Exception Handling & Thread
