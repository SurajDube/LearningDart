/*
Mixins allow for the reuse of a class's methods across multiple class hierarchies, 
  functioning like abstract classes that share similar operations or attributes.
They provide a way to abstract and reuse functionality without resorting to multiple inheritance, 
  as only one superclass exists.
The keyword with is used to include mixins in Dart, where mixins are defined as classes without constructors. 
Importantly, mixins donâ€™t enforce type restrictions or usage limitations on class methods.
