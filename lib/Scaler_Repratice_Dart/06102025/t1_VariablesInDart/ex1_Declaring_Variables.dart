/*
final

A variable with the final keyword will be initialized at runtime and can only be assigned for a single time.
In a class and function, you can define a final variable.
const

A variable with the const keyword is initialized at compile-time and is already assigned when at runtime.
We canâ€™t define const inside a class. But you can define in a function.
