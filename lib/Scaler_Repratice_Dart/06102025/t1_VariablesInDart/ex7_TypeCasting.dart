//Type inference in Dart is a feature that allows the Dart compiler to automatically gets the data type of a variable based on its assigned value.


// Type inference: the compiler gets the type based on the assigned value
void main() {
  var age = 50; // Dart infers that age is of type int
var name = 'Shyam'; // Dart infers that name is of type String
var isMale = true; // Dart infers that isStudent is of type bool
print(age);
print(name);
print(isMale);
}
